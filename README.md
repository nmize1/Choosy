# Choosy

Tool to create meal plans and grocery lists for the meals on the plans.

This is a prototype for a possible web version later.

Additional planned features:
- [x] Grocery List with measurements
- [x] Restuarant picker

# Usage

Run choosy.py or download choosy.exe (not yet released). Make sure choosy.py is in the same folder as the Resources folder.

Type a meal name in the text box and click Add Meal. Add ingredients to your meal by filling in the text boxes.
Use the Add/Remove Ingredient buttons to add more text boxes. Check the Vegetarian box if the meal is vegetarian.
Click OK to save the meal or Cancel to go back.

After at least 7 meals are added, click Generate Meal Plan to show a week's meal plan. Click OK to go back
or Grocery List to generate the grocery list for the current meal plan.

In Settings, you can set which days require vegetarian meals and whether days that don't require vegetarian meals can still select them.
